// CallSequence
// ID: 26h (38d)
// This block is an analogue of the CALL Subroutine statement. It basically executes a sequence of
// blocks that are somewhere else and then goes back to the next block. Because more than one call
// can be normally used you can include a list of sequences to be called. The 'nesting' of call
// blocks is also not allowed for the simplicity reasons. You can, of course, use the CALL blocks
// in the LOOP sequences and vice versa. The value is relative for the obvious reasons - so that
// you can add some blocks in the beginning of the file without disturbing the call values. Please
// take a look at 'Jump To Block' for reference on the values.
