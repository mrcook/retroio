# RetroIO (rio)

A command-line utility written in the Go programming language for working
with disk and cassette tape files used by emulators of home computers from
the 1980s.

One example would be `tzx` tapes from the ZX Spectrum 8-bit home computer.


## Supported Media and Commands


### Directory Command

* Amstrad:      `DSK`
* Commodore 64: `D64`, `D71`, `D81`

The `dir` command reads a disk and prints the directory listing to the terminal.
Any hidden/scratch files will also be displayed.

```sh

### Geometry Command

* Amstrad:      `DSK`, `CDT`
* Commodore 64: `D64`, `D71`, `D81`, `T64`, `TAP`
* ZX Spectrum:  `TZX`, `TAP`, `TRD`

The `geometry` command will read and display core metadata about the layout
of the media. This can be disk track and sector details, or the header and
block information from a cassette tape.

```sh
$ rio spectrum geometry skool-daze.tzx

### Read Command

* ZX Spectrum: `TZX` and `TAP`

The `read` command will read data contained on the media.

At present only printing of `BASIC` programs is supported. Simply add the `--bas`
flag when `read`ing the media image.

_Please note that decoding is currently experimental and the output may not be
considered valid BASIC, and may even be garbled or missing completely._

```sh
$ rio spectrum read --bas manic-miner.tzx

BASIC PROGRAMS:

BLK#02: ManicMiner
  10  CLEAR 30000
  20  PAPER 0: BORDER 0: INK 0: CLS : LOAD ""CODE : LOAD ""CODE 
  30  RANDOMIZE USR 33792
```

## Installation

    $ go get -u -v github.com/mrcook/retroio/...

To install the app after manually cloning the repository you must first change to the `rio` directory:

    $ cd retroio/rio
    $ go install


## Usage

    $ rio help

To display a list of commands

Note: the correct media type will be set for the requested system based
on the file extension, however this can be overridden with the `--media` flag.
