## D81 (Electronic form of a 1581 double-sided, double-density MFM disk)

    Source revision v1.4 (2008-11-07)

Like D64 and D71, this is a byte for byte copy of a physical 1581 disk. It
consists of 80 tracks, 40 sectors each (0 to 39) for a size of 819200 bytes,
or 3200 sectors. If the error byte block is attached, this makes the file size
822400 bytes.

There are three sectors on the directory track used for disk internals (header
and BAM), leaving 37 sectors for filename entries, thus allowing for 296 files
(37 * 8) to be stored at the root level of the disk.

The actual physical layout on the disk is quite different from what the user
sees, but this is unimportant to the scope of this document. One important
difference from the D64 and D71 is all the sector interleaves is now 1 for
both files and directory storage (rather than 3 for directory and 10 for file
on a D64/D71) . This is due to the built-in buffering in the 1581. When
reading a sector, the whole track will be buffered in memory, and any sectors
being modified will be done in memory. Once it has to be written, the whole
track will be written out in one step.

The track range and offsets into the D81 files are as follows:

    Side  Track  Sec/trk  # Sectors
     0     1-40     40       1600
     1    41-80     40       1600

The header sector is stored at 40/0, and contains the disk name, ID and DOS
version bytes, but the BAM is no longer contained here (like the D64).

    Bytes    Description
    $00-$01  Track/Sector location of the first directory sector (should
             be set to 40/3 but it doesn't matter, and don't trust  what
             is there, always go to 40/3 for first directory entry)
        $02  Disk DOS version type (see note below) $44 ('D') = 1581
        $03  $00
    $04-$13  16 character Disk Name (padded with $A0)
    $14-$15  $A0
    $16-$17  Disk ID
        $18  $A0
        $19  DOS Version ("3")
        $1A  Disk version ("D")
    $1B-$1C  $A0
    $1D-$FF  Unused (usually $00)

NOTE: Wikipedia states that the 1581 DOS version is 10.0.

The following might be set if the disk is a GEOS format (this info is based on
the D64 layout, and might not prove to be true)

    $AB-$AC  Border sector (GEOS only, else set to $00)
    $AD-$BC  GEOS ID string ("geos FORMAT V1.x" GEOS only, else $00)
    $BD-$FF  Unused (usually $00)

Note: If the DOS version byte is changed to anything other than a $44 (or
$00), then we have what is called "soft write protection". Any attempt to
write to the disk will return the "DOS Version" error code 73. The drive is
simply telling you that it thinks the disk format version is incompatible.

The directory track should be contained totally on track 40. Sectors 3-39
contain the entries and sector 1 and 2 contain the BAM (Block Availability
Map). Sector 0 holds the disk name and ID. The first directory sector is
always 40/3, even though the t/s pointer at 40/0 (first two bytes) might point
somewhere else. It goes linearly up the sector count, 3-4-5-6-etc. Each sector
holds up to eight entries.

The first two bytes of the sector ($28/$04) indicate the location of the next
track/sector of the directory (40/4). If the track is set to $00, then it is
the last sector of the directory. It is possible, however unlikely, that the
directory may *not* be completely on track 40. Just follow the chain anyhow.

When the directory is done (track=$00), the sector should contain an $FF,
meaning the whole sector is allocated. The actual value doesn't matter as all
the entries will be returned anyways. Each directory sector has the following
layout:

## Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commodore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory track where
all filenames are stored. This limits the number of files stored on a disk
based on the number of sectors on the directory track. There are some disk
images that contain more files than would normally be allowed. This requires
extending the directory off the default directory track by changing the last
directory sector pointer to a new track, allocating the new sectors in the
BAM, and manually placing (or moving existing) file entries there. The
directory of an extended disk can be read and the files that reside there can
be loaded without problems on a real drive. However, this is still a very
dangerous practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will
cause directory corruption in the non-extended part. Many of the floppy drives
core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is on and assume
the default directory track for operations.

To explain: assume that the directory has been extended from track 18 to track
19/6 and that the directory is full except for a few slots on 19/6. When
saving a new file, the drive DOS will find an empty file slot at 19/6 offset
$40 and correctly write the filename and a few other things into this slot.
When the file is done being saved the final file information will be written
to 18/6 offset $40 instead of 19/6 causing some directory corruption to the
entry at 18/6. Also, the BAM entries for the sectors occupied by the new file
will not be saved and the new file will be left as a SPLAT (*) file.

Attempts to validate the disk will result in those files residing off the
directory track to not be allocated in the BAM, and could also send the drive
into an endless loop. The default directory track is assumed for all sector
reads when validating so if the directory goes to 19/6, then the validate code
will read 18/6 instead. If 18/6 is part of the normal directory chain then the
validate routine will loop endlessly. 


## BAM layout

The BAM is located on 40/1 (for side 0, tracks 1-40) and 40/2 (for side 1,
tracks 41-80). Each entry takes up six bytes, one for the "free sector" count
and five for the allocation bitmap.

    $BE-$C3  BAM entry for track 30 (track 70, side 1)
      ...
    $FA-$FF  BAM entry for track 40 (track 80, side 1)

The BAM entries require some explanation, so lets look at the track 40 entry
at bytes $FA-FF ($24 $F0 $FF $2D $FF $FE). The first byte ($24, or 36 decimal)
is the number of free sectors on that track. The next five bytes represent the
bitmap of which sectors are used/free. Since it is five bytes (8 bits/byte) we
have 40 bits of storage. Since this format has 40 sectors/track, the whole
five bytes are used.

    F0: .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 24 F0 FF 2D FF FE   úúúú(úúúúú$ðú-úþ

The last five bytes of any BAM entry must be viewed in binary to make any
sense. We will once again use track 40 as our reference:

    F0=11110000, FF=11111111, 2D=00101101, FF=11111111, FE=11111110

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits around.

                      111111 11112222 22222233 33333333
    Sector 01234567 89012345 67890123 45678901 23456789

           00001111 11111111 10110100 11111111 01111111

Note that if a bit is on (1), the sector is free. Therefore, track 40 has
sectors 0-3, 17, 20, 22, 23 and 32 used, all the rest are free.

The second BAM (for side 1) contains the entries for tracks 41-80.

It is laid out exactly as the side 0 BAM except for one difference. The
track/sector reference for the next sector should be set to $00/$FF,
indicating there is no next sector.


## REL files

The REL filetype requires some extra explaining. It was designed to make
access to data *anywhere* on the disk very fast.

Take a look at this directory entry...

    00: 00 FF 84 27 00 41 44 44 49 54 49 4F 4E 41 4C 20   úú„'úADDITIONALú
    10: 49 4E 46 4F A0 27 02 FE 00 00 00 00 00 00 D2 0B   INFO '...úúúúúÒ.

The third byte ($84) indicates this entry is a REL file and that the three
normally empty entries at offset $15, $16 and $17 are now used as they are
explained above. It's the track/sector chain that this entry points to, called
the SUPER SIDE SECTOR, which is of interest here (in this case, 39/2).

The SUPER SIDE SECTOR is very different from the D64 format. If you check the
D64 entry for a REL file and do the calculations, you will find that the
maximum file size of the REL file is 720 data sectors. With the new SUPER SIDE
SECTOR, you can now have 126 groups of these SIDE SECTORS chains, allowing for
file sizes up to (theoretically) 90720 sectors, or about 22.15 Megabytes.

Here is a dump of the beginning of the SUPER SIDE SECTOR...

    00: 27 01 FE 27 01 15 09 03 0F 38 16 4A 1C 00 00 00   '.þ'.....8.J.úúú

      ...
    $FD-$FE  Track/sector of first side sector in group 125
        $FF  Unused (likely $00)


The side sector layout is the same as the D64/1571.

             Note the first entry is this very sector we have listed here. The next is the next t/s
             listed at the beginning of the sector. All of this information must be correct.
             If one of these chains is $00/$00, then we have no more side sectors.
             Also, all of these (up to six) side sectors must have the same values in this range.
    $10-$FF  T/S chains of *each* sector of the data portion.
             When we get a $00/$00, we are at the end of the file.


## 1581 Partitions and Sub-directories

At the beginning of this document it was stated that the 1581 can hold 296
entries "at the root level". The 1581 also has the ability to partition areas
of the disk. Under the right conditions these can become sub-directories,
acting as a small diskette, complete with its own directory and BAM. When you
are inside of a sub-directory, no other files except those in that directory
are visible, or can be affected.

To the 1581, this file will show up as a "CBM" filetype in a directory. All
this does is tell the disk that a file, starting at X/Y track/sector and Z
sectors large exists. Doing a validate will not harm these files as they have
a directory entry, and are fully allocated in the BAM.

There are two main uses for partitions. One is to simply allocate a section of
the disk to be used for direct-access reads/writes, and lock it away from
being overwritten after a VALIDATE. The second is as a sub-directory,
basically a small "disk within a disk".

In order to use a partition as a sub-directory, it must adhere to the
following four rules:

  1. If must start on sector 0
  2. It's size must be in multiples of 40 sectors
  3. It must be a minimum of 120 sectors long (3 tracks)
  4. If must not start on or cross track 40, which limits the biggest
     directory to 1600 sectors (tracks 1-39).

This is a dump of a sub-directory entry:

    00: 00 FF 85 29 00 50 41 52 54 49 54 49 4F 4E 20 31   úú…)úPARTITIONú1
    10: A0 A0 A0 A0 A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 06        úúúúúúúúú@.

It is a partition starting on track 41/0, extends for 1600 sectors, and has
been formatted as a sub-directory. Note that when a partition is created, the
area being allocated is not touched in any way. If you want it set up as a
sub-directory, you must issue the FORMAT command to the 1581 to create the
central directory and BAM. Also note that from the directory entry you can't
tell whether it is a sub-directory or not, just that it fits the sub-directory
parameters.

The BAM track for the sub-directory exists on the first track of the
partition, and has the same layout as the disk BAM on track 40. The biggest
difference is the "disk name" is what what given when the partition was
formatted rather than what the actual disk name is. Also, except for the free
sectors in the partition area, all other sectors in the BAM will be allocated.

If the partition size doesn't match the above rules for a sub-directory, it
will simply exist as a "protected" area of the disk, and can't be used a
sub-directory. Either way, it still shows up as a "CBM" type in a directory
listing. Below is a dump of a 10-sector partition starting on track 5/1, which
does not qualify as a sub-directory...

    00: 00 00 85 05 01 53 4D 41 4C 4C 50 41 52 54 20 32   úú…..SMALLPARTú2

The master BAM shows the entry for this partition on track 5...

    00: 28 02 44 BB 43 44 C0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   (.D»CDÀúúúúúúúúú

                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The breakdown of the BAM shows the allocation for this track, with sectors
1-10 allocated, as it should be.

    10000000 00011111 11111111 11111111 11111111
    ^          ^          ^          ^         ^
    0          10         20         30        39

Partitions and sub-directories share one very important trait. When created,
the sub-directory entry simply has the starting track/sector and the size of
the partition in sectors. Partitions are created linearly, meaning if one
starts on 30/1 and is of size 15 sectors, then the sector range from 1 through
15 on track 30 will be allocated. If a partition size crosses a track
boundary, the allocation will continue on the next track starting on sector 0,
and going up.

The section allocated will *not* have a track/sector chain like a file would,
but rather is dependant on the directory entry to keep it from being
overwritten. You can store whatever you want to in the allocated area.


## AUTO-BOOT LOADER

If byte $07 in the BAM is set, then when the drive is reset (and other
circumstances) it will look for a USR file called "COPYRIGHT CBM 86". This
file will then be loaded into the drive RAM and executed.

The format for this auto-loader file is fairly basic. It starts with a
two-byte load address, a size byte, program data, and a checksum at the end.

    Bytes           Description
    $00-$01         Load address, low/high format
        $02         Size of program (SZ) (smaller than 256 bytes)
    $03-($03+SZ-1)  Program data
    $03+SZ          Checksum byte


## Overall Good/Bad of D81 Files:

### Good

  * Most emulators support them
  * Supports *all* filenames, even those with $00's in them
  * Filenames padded with the standard $A0 character
  * Supports GEOS files
  * Supports REL files
  * Allows directory customization
  * Because it is a random-access device, it supports fast-loaders and random sector access
  * Cluster slack-space loss is minimized since the file is a larger fixed size
  * Has a label (description) field
  * With the inclusion of error bytes, you have support for basic copy-protection
  * Files on a disk can easily be re-written, as long as there is free blocks

### Bad

  * The format doesn't contain *all* the info from the 1581 disk (no sector
    header info like ID bytes, checksums). This renders some of the original
    special-loaders and copy-protection useless.
  * You don't *really* know the file size of the contained C64 files in bytes,
    only blocks
  * It can't store C64s FRZ files
    (due to FRZ files needing a special flag that a D81 can't store)
  * Directory limited to 296 files maximum
  * It is not an expandable filesize, like LNX or T64, but the directory is
    large enough not to worry about this limitation
  * Unless most of the space on a D81 disk is used, you do end up with lost space
  * Cannot have loadable files with the same names
  * Has no recognizeable file signature (unlike most other formats). The only
    reliable way to know if a file is a D81 is by its size
  * It is too easy for people to muck up the standard layout
  * It is much more difficult to support fully, as you really need to emulate
    the 1581 DOS (sector interleave, REL support, GEOS interleave)
