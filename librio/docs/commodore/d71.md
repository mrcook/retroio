## D71 (Electronic form of a double-sided 1571 disk)

    Source revision v1.5 (2008-11-07)

Similar to the D64 (1541), the 1571 drive can operate in either single-sided
(1541 compatible) mode or double-sided (1571) mode. In this document I will be
dealing with the double-sided mode only. For the breakdown of the single-sided
mode, read the D64.TXT document.

The D71 has 70 tracks, double that of the 1541, with a DOS file size of 349696
bytes. If the error byte block (1366 bytes) is attached, this makes the file
size 351062 bytes. The track range and offsets into the D71 files are as
follows:

## Directory

The directory structure is the same as a D64/1541. All the same filetypes
apply, the directory still only holds 144 files per disk and should only exist
on track 18.

The first two bytes of the sector ($12/$04 or 18/4) indicate the location of
the next track/sector of the directory. If the track value is set to $00, then
it is the last sector of the directory. It is possible, however unlikely, that
the directory may *not* be completely on track 18 (some disks do exist like
this). Just follow the chain anyhow.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00. The sector link
should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is allocated, but the
actual value doesn't matter. The drive will return all the available entries
anyways. This is a breakdown of a standard directory sector and entry:

    Bytes    Description
    $00-$1F  First directory entry
    $00-$01  Track/Sector location of next directory sector ($00/$FF if its the last sector)
        $02  File type.
             Typical values for this location are:
               $00 - Scratched (deleted file entry)
                80 - DEL
                81 - SEQ
                82 - PRG
                83 - USR
                84 - REL
             Bit 0-3: The actual filetype
                      000 (0) - DEL
                      001 (1) - SEQ
                      010 (2) - PRG
                      011 (3) - USR
                      100 (4) - REL
                      Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange results.
                      The 1541 is inconsistent in how it treats these bits. Some routines use
                      all 4 bits, others ignore bit 3, resulting in values from 0-7.
             Bit   4: Not used
             Bit   5: Used only during SAVE-@ replacement
             Bit   6: Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
             Bit   7: Closed flag (Not set produces  "*", or "splat" files)
    $03-$04  Track/sector location of first sector of file
    $05-$14  16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
    $15-$16  Track/Sector location of side-sector block (REL file only)
        $17  REL file record length (REL file only)
    $18-$1D  **Unused (except with GEOS disks)
    $1C-$1D  **Track/sector of replacement file (only used during an @SAVE or an @OPEN command)
    $1E-$1F  File size in sectors, low/high byte order ($1E+$1F*256).
             The approx. filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254
    $20-$3F  Second dir entry. From now on the first two bytes of each entry
             in this sector should be $00/$00, as they are unused.
    $40-$5F  Third dir entry
    $60-$7F  Fourth dir entry
    $80-$9F  Fifth dir entry
    $A0-$BF  Sixth dir entry
    $C0-$DF  Seventh dir entry
    $E0-$FF  Eighth dir entry

** Note the overlapping bytes in the docs [MRC]

### Interleave

When the 1571 is in is native ("1571") mode, files are stored with a sector
interleave of 6, rather than 10 which the 1541 (and the 1571 in "1541" mode)
uses. The directory still uses an interleave of 3.


## Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commodore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory track where
all filenames are stored. This limits the number of files stored on a disk
based on the number of sectors on the directory track. There are some disk
images that contain more files than would normally be allowed. This requires
extending the directory off the default directory track by changing the last
directory sector pointer to a new track, allocating the new sectors in the
BAM, and manually placing (or moving existing) file entries there. The
directory of an extended disk can be read and the files that reside there can
be loaded without problems on a real drive. However, this is still a very
dangerous practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will
cause directory corruption in the non-extended part. Many of the floppy drives
core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is on and assume
the default directory track for operations.

To explain: assume that the directory has been extended from track 18 to track
19/6 and that the directory is full except for a few slots on 19/6. When
saving a new file, the drive DOS will find an empty file slot at 19/6 offset
$40 and correctly write the filename and a few other things into this slot.
When the file is done being saved the final file information will be written
to 18/6 offset $40 instead of 19/6 causing some directory corruption to the
entry at 18/6. Also, the BAM entries for the sectors occupied by the new file
will not be saved and the new file will be left as a SPLAT (*) file.

Attempts to validate the disk will result in those files residing off the
directory track to not be allocated in the BAM, and could also send the drive
into an endless loop. The default directory track is assumed for all sector
reads when validating so if the directory goes to 19/6, then the validate code
will read 18/6 instead. If 18/6 is part of the normal directory chain then the
validate routine will loop endlessly. 


## BAM layout

The BAM is somewhat different as it now has to take 35 new tracks into
account. In order to do this, most of the extra BAM information is stored on
track 53/0, and the remaining sectors on track 53 are marked in the BAM as
allocated. This does mean that except for one allocated sector on track 53,
the rest of the track is unused and wasted. (Track 53 is the equivalent to
track 18, but on the flip side of the disk).

Here is a dump of the first BAM sector...

    Bytes    Description
    $00-$01  Track/Sector location of the first directory sector (should
             be set to 18/1 but it doesn't matter, and don't trust what
             is there, always go to 18/1 for first directory entry)
        $02  Disk DOS version type (see note below) $41 ('A') = 1541
        $03  Double-sided flag
               $00 - Single sided disk
               $80 - Double sided disk
    $04-$8F  BAM entries for each track, in groups of four bytes per track,
             starting on track 1.
    $90-$9F  Disk Name (padded with $A0)
    $A0-$A1  Filled with $A0
    $A2-$A3  Disk ID
        $A4  Usually $A0
        $A5  DOS version ("2")
        $A6  Disk version ("A")
    $A7-$AA  Filled with $A0
    $AB-$DC  Not used ($00's)
    $DD-$FF  Free sector count for tracks 36-70 (1 byte/track).

NOTE: Wikipedia states that the DOS version for the 1571 is v3.0 (and v3.1 for
the C128DCR built-in 1571 drive). It also notes that a revised firmware for the
1571 (fixing a relative file bug) was also identified as v3.0, and therefore it's
not possible to differentiate the two versions using the version number alone.

The "free sector" entries for tracks 36-70 are likely included here in the
first BAM sector due to some memory restrictions in the 1571 drive. There is
only enough memory available for one BAM sector, but in order to generate the
"blocks free" value at the end of a directory listing, the drive needs to know
the extra track "free sector" values. It does make working with the BAM a
little more difficult, though.

These are the values that would normally be with the 4-byte BAM entry, but the
rest of the entry is contained on 53/0.

Note: If the DOS version byte is set to anything other than $41 or $00, then
we have what is called "soft write protection". Any attempt to write to the
disk will return the "DOS Version" error code 73. The 1571 is simply telling
you that it thinks the disk format version is incorrect.

The BAM entries require some explanation. Take the first entry at bytes
$04-$07 ($12 $FF $F9 $17). The first byte ($12) is the number of free sectors
on that track. Since we are looking at the track 1 entry, this means it has 18
(decimal) free sectors.

The next three bytes represent the bitmap of which sectors are used/free.
Since it is 3 bytes (8 bits/byte) we have 24 bits of storage. Remember that at
most, each track only has 21 sectors, so there are a few unused bits. These
entries must be viewed in binary to make any sense. We will use the first
entry (track 1) at bytes 04-07:

    FF=11111111, F9=11111001, 17=00010111

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits around.

               111111 11112222
    01234567 89012345 67890123
    --------------------------
    11111111 10011111 11101000
    ^                     ^
    sector 0           sector 20

Since we are on the first track, we have 21 sectors, and only use up to the
bit 20 position. If a bit is on (1), the sector is free. Therefore, track 1
has sectors 9,10 and 19 used, all the rest are free.

In order to complete the BAM, we must check 53/0.

Each track from 36-70 has 3 byte entries, starting at address $00.

    Bytes    Bitmap       Description
    $00-$02  $FF $FF $1F  BAM map for track 36
    $03-$05  $FF $FF $1F  BAM map for track 37
      ...
    $33-$35  $00 $00 $00  BAM map for track 53
      ...
    $66-$68  $FF $FF $01  BAM map for track 70
    $69-$FF               Not used

You can break down the entries for tracks 36-70 the same way as track 1, just
combine the free sector bytes from 18/0 and the BAM usage from 53 to get the
full 4-byte entry.

Just like a D64, you can attach error bytes to the file, for sector error
information. This block is 1366 bytes long, 1 byte for each of the 1366
sectors in the image. With the error bytes, the file size is 351062 bytes.


## REL files

The REL filetype requires some extra explaining. It was designed to make
access to data *anywhere* on the disk very fast. Take a look at this directory
entry (see the `Directory` section for a full description of the directory
structure):

    00: 00 00 84 11 02 41 44 44 49 54 49 4F 4E 41 4C 20  úú„..ADDITIONALú
    10: 49 4E 46 4F A0 11 0C FE 00 00 00 00 00 00 61 01  INFO ..þúúúúúúa.

The third byte ($84) indicates this entry is a REL file and that the three
normally empty entries at offset $15, $16 and $17 are now used as they are
explained above. It's the track/sector chain that this entry points to, called
the SIDE SECTOR, which is of interest here (in this case, 17/12). If you check
the D64 document for a REL file and do the calculations, you will find that
the maximum file size of the REL file is 720 data sectors.

The side sector layout is the same as the D64.

    00: 02 11 00 FE 11 0C 07 13 04 09 00 00 00 00 00 00
    10: 11 02 11 0D 11 03 11 0E 11 04 11 0F 11 05 11 10

    Bytes    Description
        $00  Track location of next side-sector ($00 if last sector)
        $01  Sector location of next side-sector
        $02  Side-sector block number: first sector is $00, the next is $01, $02, etc.
        $03  REL file RECORD size (from directory entry, max. value 254)
    $04-$0F  Track/sector locations of the six other side-sectors. Note the
             first entry is this very sector we have listed here. The next is
             the next t/s listed at the beginning of the sector. All of this
             information must be correct. If one of these chains is $00/$00,
             then we have no more side sectors. Also, all of these (up to six)
             side sectors must have the same values in this range.
    $10-$FF  T/S chains of *each* sector of the data  portion.
             When we get a $00/$00, we are at the end of the file.


## Overall Good/Bad of D71 Files:

### Good

  * Most emulators support these.
  * Supports *all* filenames, even those with 00's in them
  * Filenames are padded with the standard $A0 character
  * Supports GEOS files
  * Supports REL files
  * Allows full directory customization
  * Because it is a random-access device, it supports fast-loaders and random sector access
  * Cluster slack-space loss is minimized since the file is a larger fixed size
  * Has a label (description) field
  * With the inclusion of error bytes, you have support for basic copy-protection
  * Files on a disk can easily be re-written, as long as there is free blocks


### Bad

  * The format doesn't contain *all* the info from the 1571 disk (no sector
    header info like ID bytes, checksums). This renders some of the original
    special-loaders and copy-protection useless.
  * You don't *really* know the file size of the contained C64 files in bytes,
    only blocks
  * It can't store C64s FRZ files due to FRZ files needing a special flag that
    a D71 can't store
  * It is not an expandable filesize, like LNX or T64
  * Unless most of the space on a D71 disk is used, you do end up with lost space
  * Directory limited to 144 files maximum
  * Cannot have loadable files with the same names
  * Has no recognizeable file signature (unlike most other formats). The only
    reliable way to know if a file is a D71 is by its size
  * It is too easy for people to muck up the standard layout
  * It is much more difficult to support fully, as you really need to emulate
    the 1571 DOS (sector interleave, REL support, GEOS interleave)
