# ZX Spectrum Storage Media Documentation

NOTE: all of the documentation for TAP/TZX images from the below sources has
been inlined with the code.


## TZX Specification

Source: https://www.worldofspectrum.org/TZXformat.html

`TZX` is a file format designed to preserve cassette tapes compatible with the
ZX Spectrum computers, although some specialized versions of the format have
been defined for other machines such as the Amstrad CPC and C64.

The format was originally created by Tomaz Kac, who was maintainer until
`revision 1.13`, before passing it to Martijn v.d. Heide. For a brief period
the Ramsoft company became the maintainers, and created revision `v1.20`.

The default file extension is `.tzx`.

The tape files processable with this program are based on the TZX specification,
revision: 1.20 (2006-12-19), therefore the following `hex` block ID's are not
supported: `16`, `17`, `34`, `35`, and `40`.

NOTE: `GeneralizedData` blocks are also not currently supported.
